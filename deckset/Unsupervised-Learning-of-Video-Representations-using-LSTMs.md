# Introduction

- Videos are very high dimensional entity compared to single image.
- Very difficult to credit assignment and learn long range structure

# Introduction

- To keep low dimension
	- unless collect more labelled data
	- or do feature engineering like flow features

- Needs unsupervised learning to find represent structure in videos.

---

# [fit] Lets' utilize temporal structure of videos as
# [fit] a supervisory signal for unsupervised learning.

^Understanding temporal sequences is important for solving many video related problems.
Learning good representations of videos requires a model that captures both spatial and temporal information presented in videos.

# [fit] Use the LSTM Encoder-Decoder[^1]
# [fit] to learn good video representations.

# [fit] In this paper, the author proposed three models based on LSTM

- Autoencoder Model
- Future Predictor Model
- Composite Model

---

# 1) LSTM Autoencoder Model:

![right fit ](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v82521taskchdhz/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7%202016-11-20%2022.50.40.png?raw=1)

- This model is composed of two parts, the encoder and the decoder.
- In Autoencoder the target sequence is the same as the input sequence but in reverse order to make optimization easier for model.


---
# AutuEncoder: Intuition

- The reconstruction work requires the network to **capture information about the appearance of objects and the background**

- This is exactly the information that we would like **the representation to contain**.

^Why this should learn good features?
Encoder output : representation of the input video. Should retain information of video.
Decoder : should reconstruct back the input from the representation



---

# 2) LSTM Future Predictor Model:

![right fit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0e19wte94ghehp6/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7%202016-11-20%2022.53.34.png?raw=1)

 - In Future Predictor, the Decoder LSTM predicts the sequence of frames in video that come just after the input sequence.
 - It also varies with conditional/unconditional versions.


---


# Conditional Decoder

- allows decoder to model multiple modes to target distribution
	- without it, averaging multiple modes in low-level input space
- Frames have strong short-term correlation
	- let decoder easy to pick up correlation
	- unconditional decoder is forced to look for information deep inside the encoder.

![right fit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y12cxlymccd4kv2/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7%202016-11-21%2001.20.24.png?raw=1)

---
# Future Predctor: Intuition

In order to **predict the next few frames correctly**,

the model needs information about **which objects are present and how they are moving so that the motion can be extrapolated.**

---


# 3) A Composite Model:

![right fit](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ztp167oqbpxfja6/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7%202016-11-20%2022.55.50.png?raw=1)

- The Composite Model combines together the best parts of Autoencoder and Future Predictor to form a more powerful model.
- These two modules share a same encoder, which encodes input sequences into a feature vector and copy them to different decoders.

---

# Overcome each models:

High capacity **autoencoder**
- would memorize the input very well.
- But not useful to predicting Future

**Future predictor** tend to store information only  last few frames
- since last frames are the important
- will forget large part of the

# [fit] Thus remember the *past* and predict the **future**

---

# Composite model: Intuition

Learns representations that contain
 **not only static appearance** of objects & background,
 **but also the dynamic informations** like moving objects and their moving pattern.

---

# Goal of Experiments


- Qualitative understanding what the LSTM learns to do
- Better performance on supervised task with **initializing networks with the weights found by unsupervised learning**, *especially with very few training examples*.
- Compare the three proposed models and conditional variants
- Compare with state-of-the-art action recognition benchmarks.

 The model needs to know about motion (which direction and how fast things are moving) from the input. This requires precise information about **location (thin strips)** and **velocity (high frequency strips)**. But when it is generating the output, the model wants to hedge its bets so that it does not suffer **a huge loss for predicting things sharply at the wrong place**. This could explain why the **output features have somewhat bigger blobs**. The relative **shortness of the strips in the output features** can be explained by the fact that in the inputs, it does not hurt to have a longer feature than what is needed to detect a location because information is coarse-coded through multiple features. But in the output, the model may not want to put down a feature that is bigger than any digit because other units will have to conspire to correct for it.
